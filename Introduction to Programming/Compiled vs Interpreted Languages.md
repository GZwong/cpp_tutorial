# Introduction to programming

A CPU can only read binary machine code (0's and 1's). It is obviously impractical for programmers to type in machine code to instruct the CPU to perform certain operations. One set of machine code program designed for a specific CPU architecture may not be suitable for another architecture! 

High level programming languages are used to solve this issue. They allow programmers to write in a more readable manner. Ultimately, these high level programming languages need to be translated into machine code to be read by the CPU. This translation can occur by **compilation** or **interpretation**:

1. **Compilation** - The source code is compiled into an executable file (usually .exe) file by a compiler. The executable can then be run. These are two separate processes, i.e., running the executable for the second time will not involve compilation. 

    
2. **Interpretation** - The source code is directly executed line-by-line without compiling it into an executable. The interpretation occurs everytime the program is run.

Examples of compiled programming languages are C, C++. Examples of interpreted programming languages are python.
